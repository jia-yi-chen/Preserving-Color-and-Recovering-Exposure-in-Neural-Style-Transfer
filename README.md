# Illumination-guided Neural Style Transfer

This method is able to generate fine artworks for the following subjects:
* 3D models which include a digital real-world scene or an object;
* 2D photos which contain a lot of sunlight or complex lighting conditions, such as lanscapes, sky, natural objects, and etc.

This method can preserve the illumination and scene structure of the input photos, during the process of neural style transfer.

## Requirements

* python 3
* pytorch 1.0+
* matlab

## Getting Started

* Photo images and style images: "/inputs/inputs/"
* Illumination maps:  "/inputs/inputs_semlight/"
* output artworks (there are some results examples in it): "/outputs/STYLE_NAME/"
* codes in the folder "/IIumination_matlab/" are used for calculating illumination maps
* codes in the folder "/image_analogy/" are models and losses used for illumination-guided neural style transfer, built upon [neural image analogies](https://github.com/awentzonline/image-analogies) by Adam Wentz.
* main function: "/scripts/main.py"
