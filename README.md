# Preserving Color and Recovering Exposure in Neural Style Transfer

## Task 1: Recovering Exposure in Neural Style Transfer

* A simple pre-processing module for [Neural Style Transfer](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.html), but allows NST to be robust to poor quality images in our dailty life.

## Task 2: Preserving Color in Neural Style Transfer

* A simple pre-processing module for [Neural Style Transfer](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.html), but effective to preserve colors of content image during the transfer of stylistic textures.
